Let’s kickoff the new season of meetups by diving into #Hacktoberfest! If you haven’t already heard about it, head over to https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/ and register to track your progress throughout the month.

Schedule:
- 5:00pm Open doors, arrive early to meet the group
- 6:00pm Start presentation of the day
- 6:30pm Lightning talks

This month we'll have Kim Noel talking about Open Source!

> We’ll go through a kick run down of the history behind Hacktoberfest, an intro to open source and a short demo about contributing – what a documentation contribution looks like, what a code sample contribution looks like, and maybe even checkout some core code contributions! We will also explore what it takes to create a community around your open source project and how to help ensure folks feel safe approaching and contributing to your OSS project.

After this talk, we plan to have lightning talks from the crowd - five minutes each - about open source projects you love or worked on. If you want to present anything just make sure to arrive a bit earlier so that we can get your name on the list.
