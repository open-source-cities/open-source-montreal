eQualitie develops open and reusable systems with a focus on privacy, online
security, and information management.  Our goal is to create accessible
technology and improve the skill set needed for defending human rights and
freedoms in the digital age.

We are software developers and system engineers, cryptographers, security
auditors, penetration testers, project managers, trainers, anthropologists,
communicators and more!  Most importantly, weâ€™re all driven to promote and
defend principles enshrined within the
[eQualitie Manifesto](https://equalit.ie/equalit-ie-manifesto/).
